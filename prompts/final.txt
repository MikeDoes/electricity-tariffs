A pdf file with electricity tariffs of Swiss DSO is provided. Electricity tariffs are structured as follows:
a) there ist a certain number of products
b) for each product, the price is split into various components: there is a price for the Energy (Energie), one for the grid (Netznutzung) and one or
more additional taxes (Abgaben)
c) the energy price is sometimes split into a high tariff (Hochtarif) and a low tariff (Niedertarif oder Normaltarif) which depends on the time of day. Weekends are normally low tariff.

Please respond only with the JSON without any additional words.

In the JSON schema when you see something like "Von 00:00 bis 01:00 in Rp./kWh" we would like to Fill this field with the price
in that day and hour of the day. If there is nothing specified (no matter if Summer or Winter) please use the standard tariff as
this field should never be zero.

It is important to analyse the structure of the tariff sheet before extracting the data:
Some DSOs present the products as rows and the price components as columns. Others present the products as
the columns and the components as rows.
